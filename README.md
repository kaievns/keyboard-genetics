# Keyboard Genetics

This project is an attempt to discover and design the most efficient keyboard
layout by using an evolution algorithm based AI.

The project is officially finished and the final result can be found over here

[Halmak](https://github.com/MadRabbit/halmak) keyboard layout.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository

2. Create the `text` folder and fill it in with `*.txt` files which you'd like
   to use as the test data source. I used a series of articles from various
   online media. I don't have copyrights to provide them with this project, so
   you will have to use your own source.

3. Run `npm start` to boot the AI design process. Exact constrains can be set
   in the `src/genome.js` file.

4. Run `npm test` to run the final comparisons against existing layouts
